Step 1, digestion:

Use buffer and proteinase from a kit (e.g, Omega kit, )
Add 180uL buffer
Add 20uL Proteinase 
Incubate overnight at 55oC and 450 RPM in thermomixer, vortexing regularly
Transfer all sample to 1.5 mL sterile tubes
Add equal volume (200uL) of **either** 24:1 Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol **or** 25:24:1 Phenol:Chlorophorm:Isoamyl alcohol to each tube
Spin at max speed for 2 min
Trasnfer the supernatant to a clean 1.5mL sterile tube
Repeat steps x-x (add more P:C to the pellet, to get any residual DNA from digested tissue left over in pellet)
Discard pellet

Purification

Add 1/10 (~40uL) of 5M ammonium acetate to the supernatant and mix well
Add 2x volume (~800uL) of cold 100% EtOH and mix well
Place samples in freezer (-20oC) for ~20min
Spin at max speed for 10min
Transfer supernatant into a new tube and add 1mL of 70% EtOH made fresh
Mix well, spin at max speed for 2 min
Discard supernatant and air dry pellet
Can repeat stepps after place in freezer if needed
Resuspend pellet in 30-100uL of MG water.
