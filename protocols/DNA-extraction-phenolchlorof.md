## DNA extraction

-----------------------------
### Bench prep and materials
-----------------------------

* 1st (10%) bleach entire benchtop
* 2nd (70-90%) EtOH entire benchtop
* gloves
* beaker with ~50mL 90% EtOH
* ligther
* blades - one per sample
* sharps container
* trash bin
* scale
* weigh paper - one per sample
* kimwipes
* autoclaved or filtered/sterile pipette tips
* 1.5mL autoclaved eppendorf tubes (3x per sample)

From tissue DNA extraction kit (E-Z 96 D1196-01, Omega or Qiagen kit):

* TL buffer - 180 uL per sample
* protease solution 20 uL per sample

--------------------------
### Procedure
------------------------

**Digestion - step 1, day 1**

1.	Prep tubes:
  * Spin tubes: pipette 180 uL of TL (Omega kit) or ATL (Qiagen kit) buffer directly into each 1.5 mL autoclaved eppendorf tube.

2.	Take 4-8 samples out of the freezer at the time; keep them on ice or cold beads.

  * Wipe bench with EtOH and gloved hands (between samples).
  * Flame tweezers (between samples) and blade (use one per sample).
  * Set weigh paper (use one per sample) onto scale and tare.
  * Take out a fin clip from first sample tube and place on a fresh kimwipe and squeeze with tweezers and blade to dry it out/get rid of liquid, to get accurate weight.
  * Cut a piece of the fin and weigh it â€“ aim for 15 to 20 mg. Save the leftover sample, put back in sample tube.
  * Remove the weigh paper with fin from balance and cut up fin in smaller pieces. Place cut up sample into corresponding spin tube using tweezers (if a piece falls out or touches any other surface, discard).
  * Repeat step 2 until all samples are in buffer.

3.	Add 20uL of OB protease (Omega kit) or proteinase K (Qiagen kit) solution into each tube

*Note: make sure samples are completely submersed in buffer - if not, add more buffer + protease and adjust volume of buffer in the following steps accordingly, as indicated.*

4.	Place tubes in thermomixer overnight at 55oC and 450 RPM, vortexing at regular intervals

**Purification - step 2, day 2**

> Prepare the following for purification: place 100% EtOH in freezer and make fresh 70% EtOH solution.

5. Transfer all sample to new 1.5 mL sterile tubes

6. Add one volume (~200uL) of **either** 24:1 Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol **or** 25:24:1 Phenol:Chlorophorm:Isoamyl alcohol to each tube

7. Spin at max speed for 2 min

8. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5mL sterile tube

9. Repeat steps 6-8 (i.e., add more Phenol:Chlorophorm:Isoamyl alcohol to the pellet, to get any residual DNA from digested tissue left over in pellet)

10. Discard pellet

*Ethanol precipitation*:

11. Add 1/10 (~40uL) of 5M ammonium acetate to the supernatant and mix well

12. Add 2x volume (~800uL) of cold 100% EtOH and mix well

13. Place samples in freezer (-20oC) for ~20min

14. Spin at max speed for 10min

15. Transfer supernatant into a new tube and add 1mL of 70% EtOH made fresh

16. Mix well, spin at max speed for 2 min

17. Discard supernatant and air dry pellet

Optional - repeat steps 14-16 (*Sara didn't do this step*)

18. Resuspend pellet in 30-100uL of MG water.
