From the sequencing facility:

"We request DNA to be sent with volumes >20 ul and concentrations >25 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit since Nanodrop will tend to overestimate the amount of double stranded DNA available. However, we input 10 ul of DNA at 10 ng/ul into our GBS library preparation, so DNA >10 ng/ul as measured by Picogreen or Qubit is acceptable. Our library prep rate includes an initial Picogreen QC step, and we can still attempt library prep on sequencing on samples with concentrations <10 ng/ul. We have successfully sequenced samples with initial concentrations <5 ng/ul, however, the results are more variable and we cannot guarantee that the samples will be successful."
