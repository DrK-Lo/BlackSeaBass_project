### Bench prep and materials
---------------------------
* 1st (10%) bleach entire benchtop
* 2nd (70-90%) EtOH entire benchtop
* gloves
* beaker with ~50mL 90% EtOH
* ligther
* blades - one per sample
* sharps container
* trash bin
* scale
* weigh paper - one per sample
* kimwipes
* autoclaved or filtered/sterile pipette tips
* 1.5mL autoclaved eppendorf tubes (2x per sample, tubes method-only)

From E-Z 96 tissue DNA kit (D1196-01, Omega) - plates (P) method:
* lysis plate
* plate seal paper
* TL buffer - 200 uL per sample
* protease solution 25 uL per sample
* BL, HBC and DNA wash buffers
* E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate)
* 96-well square-well plates
* 96-well racked microtubes and caps

From E.Z.N.A tissue DNA kit (D3396-02, Omega) - tubes (T) method:
* 2mL collection tubes (2x per sample)
* TL buffer - 200 uL per sample
* protease solution 25 uL per sample
* BL, HBC and DNA wash buffers
* E-Z HiBind DNA mini columns (individual)

> *Note: there are some small differences between the methods: when using plates, the BL buffer is added right after the time in thermomixer, on top of the TL buffer, and then the samples are centrifuged to eliminate extra tissue and so the supernatant is comprised of unpurified DNA in a mixture of TL and BL buffers; when using tubes, the sample is centrifuged right out of the thermomixer, the supernatant (unpurified DNA in TL buffer) is transfered out and then we add BL buffer. It is just a matter of logistics that have to do with spinning a plate versus spinning a tube. Shouldn't give any more or less yield.
------------------------------------------
### Procedure
-----------------------------
#### Digestion - step 1, day 1 (the following corresponds to setps 1-4, page 8-9 in the kit manual (P), or quick guide (T))

1. Prep plate or tubes:

    * Lysis plates (P): pour TL buffer in a sterile weigh boat and use multi-channel to load plate wells with **200 uL of TL buffer per well**. Tips should not touch side of wells, if they do, replace tips.

    * Spin tubes (T): pipette **200 uL of TL buffer** directly into each 1.5 mL autoclaved eppendorf tube.

2. Take 4-8 samples out of the freezer at the time; keep them on ice or cold beads.

    * Wipe bench with EtOH and gloved hands (between samples).

    * Flame tweezers (between samples) and blade (use one per sample).

    * Set weigh paper (use one per sample) onto scale and tare.

    * Take out a fin clip from first sample tube and place on a fresh kimwipe and squeeze with tweezers and blade to dry it out/get rid of liquid, to get accurate weight.

    * Cut a piece of the fin and weigh it – aim for **15 to 20 mg**. Save the leftover sample, put back in sample tube.
    
    * Remove the weigh paper with fin from balance and cut up fin in smaller pieces. Place cut up sample into corresponding plate well or spin tube using tweezers (if a piece falls out or touches any other surface, discard).
    
    * Repeat step 2 until all samples are in buffer.

3.  Add 25uL of OB protease solution into each well/tube

    *Note: make sure samples are completely submersed in buffer - if not, add more buffer + protease and adjust volume of buffer in the following steps accordingly, as indicated.*

4. Place plate (cover with silicone mat) or tubes in thermomixer overnight at 60oC and 450 RPM

------------------------------------------
#### Purification - step 2, day 2 (the following corresponds to steps 5-25 in the kit manual, page 9-11, with few modifications for plates (P) and the E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA kit quick guide for tubes (T)).

> *Buffer order: BL, HBC and DNA wash buffer - all stored at room temperature; elution buffer is not used, we elute in miliQ water at 60 – 70oC (ASK KATIE)*

> *Dilute **BL** buffer with 100% **ethanol** before use; volume of EtOH to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 25mL; D1196-01, add 100mL; D1196-02, add 500mL) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*

> *Dilute **HBC** buffer with 100% **isopropanol** before use; volume of isopropanol to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 16mL; D1196-01, add 78mL; D1196-02, add 109mL per bottle) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*

> *Dilute **DNA wash buffer** buffer with 100% **ethanol** before use; volume of isopropanol to add varies depending on which kit you have (kit ID D1196-00, add 100mL; D1196-01, add 400mL; D1196-02, add 800mL per bottle) - this is done once, mark cap of bottle once you've done it.*
---------------------------------------------------------
   ##### **PURIFICATION USING PLATES** (cheaper per sample):
   > *hint: if using the 300 uL multichannel pipette, do not load more than 250 uL (it gets too close to the top of the pipettor and could contaminate)*

5. (P) Shake or vortex the plate vigorously (holding the silicone cover mat) and ensure the lysate is completely homogeneous after shaking (if not further digestion is required). 

      * skip the optional step "add RNAse".

6. (P) Add two volumes (~450 uL) of BL buffer to each sample, then vortex samples for 1 min. 

7. (P) Spin down for 4 min at top speed (because we have large pieces of tissue that won’t settle if just briefly spun, as described in the kit manual; also don’t want to spin too long because DNA will settle too and could be lost).

      * skip the optional step "Column Equilibration"

8. (P) Place E-Z 96 DNA plate (mini-columns plate) on top of a 96-well square-well plate - tape them together.

9. (P) Pipette supernatant carefully out of lysis plate wells and into the mini-columns plate (discard the pellet) – large pieces of poorly digested tissue are likely to clog the tips and make it difficult to transfer.

10. (P) Seal the E-Z 96 DENA Plate with aeraSeal film.

11. (P) Centrifuge at 4,000xg for 10 min. Then confirm that each sample has passed through the membrane in each well of the E-Z 96 DNA plate and into the square-well plate.

12. (P) Remove and discard the aeraseal film.

13. (P) Add 500 ul of HBC buffer (previously diluted) into to each mini-column and seal the plate with new aeraseal film.

14. (P) Centriguge 4,000xg for 5 min. then discard filtrate and reause the square-well plate.

15. (P) Remove and discard aeraseal film

16. (P) Add 600ul DNA wash buffer (diluted) to each well, seal the plate with new aeraseal film.

17. (P) Centrifuge 4000xg for 5 min, discard filtrate and re-tape/reuse the square-well plate.

18. (P) Repeat steps 15-17 for a second DNA wash step.

19. (P) Centrifuge the empty plate at 4000 g for 15 min. Discard the filtrate and the square-well plate.

      * skip the optional step "Dry samples at 70oC".

20. (P) Transfer the mini-column plate to a set of 96-well racked microtubes (from kit).

21. (P) Remove and discard the aeraseal film.

22. (P) Add 200uL ~~Elution buffer~~ - we are using Molecular Grade water instead.

23. (P) Let it sit for 2-5 minutes.

24. (P) Centrifuge at 4000g for 5 min.

      * we do the following optional step "repeate steps 21-24 for a second elution step" (increases DNA yield but decreases DNA concentration. If higher concentration is desired, the second elution can be done with 200uL eluate from first elution, reheated to 70oC); collect the second eluate into the same tube used for the first elution.

25. (P) Seal the 96-racked microtubes with their caps and store at -20oC.
------------------------------------------------------
##### **PURIFICATION USING TUBES** (more expensive per sample):

5. (T) Take tubes out of thermomixer, centrifuge at >10,000 for 5 min. 

6. (T) Transfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Do not disturbe or transfer any of the insoluble pellet. Discard pellet.

7. (T) Add 220 uL BL buffer (adjust volume based on amount of starting material, if needed). Vortex to mix (a wispy precipitate may form upon addition of BL, ignore it).

8. (T) Incubate at 70oC for 10 min.

9. (T) Add 220 uL 100% ethanol (adjust this volume based on amount of starting material if needed). Vortex to mix.

10. (T) Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection tube.

11. (T) Transfer the entire sample from setp 9 to the column including any precipitates that may have formed.

12. (T) Centrifuge at max speed for 1 min, then discard the filtrate and reuse the collection tube.

13. (T) Add 500uL HBC buffer (previously diluted).

14. (T) Centrifuge at max speed for 30 sec, discard filtrate and collection tubes. 

15. (T) Insert the used column into a new collection tube.

16. (T) Add 70 uL DNA wash buffer (previously diluted), centrifuge at max speed for 30 sec, discard the filtrate and reused the collection tube.

17. (T) Repeat steps 16 for a second DNA wash step.

18. (T) Centrifuge the empty column at max speed for 2 min to dry the column - this step is critical to remove trace ethanol that will interfer with downstream applications.

19. (T) Transfer the column into a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 

20. (T) Add 100-200uL Elution Buffer (or miliQ water?) heated to 70oC, let it sit for 2 min. Centrifuge at max speed for 1 min.

21. (T) Repeat step 20 for a second elution step.

22. (T) Store eluted DNA at -20oC.

### Gel to check extraction worked

Agarose 1.5% (in 70 mL TBE buffer) (1.05 g agarose in 70mL for a small gel plate; 3.15 g in 210mL for a medium gel plate).

Melt and add 7uL GelRed (1X final, stock is 10,000X)

Cover with TBE buffer 

Ladder: 5uL + 2uL Loading buffer

Sample: 4uL + uL Loading buffer

Voltage: 100 V

Time: 45-60 min 

*Note: from previous experience, run gels a little longer and/or higher voltage (110-120) when running medium size gels.

---------------------------------------------------

### 26-Feb-2020

### BSB DNA extractions, round 1.

*Note: upon thawing samples for extraction, I noticed that samples from NC and NJ have very small amount of tissue. Sara recommends not using them in the first round of extraction (practice more before dealing with such small tissues)*

Digestion

Solutions used: buffer "1", protease "1" (we have two kits in the lab, randomly labelling kits "1" and "2" just to keep track of which ones I'm using for which samples).

Samples selected for 1st round of extraction, plate method:

| Location | UniqueID | Fin_clip_vial_ID|
|:---------|:--------:|:--------------:|
| MD | Cs_MD_139 | Cs_MD_064 |
| MD | Cs_MD_143 | Cs_MD_068 |
| ME | Cs_ME_165 | 103116 |
| MD | Cs_MD_150 | Cs_MD_076 |
| MD | Cs_MD_140 | Cs_MD_065 |
| MD | Cs_MD_162 | Cs_MD_088 |
| SN | Cs_SN_179 | 79 |
| NEG| NA | NA |

*NEG = negative control, extraction solutions only, no tissue.*

This took ~3h but including the time it takes to thaw out samples in OGL buffer; processing took ~1.5h.

----------------------
### 27-Feb-2020

Purification

Final volume was 400 uL (in MG water), visible pellets in the eluate (normal, but maybe too big).

Gel to check, from left to right: ladder, #139, #143, #165, #150, #140, #162, #179, NEG (all 4uL,except #143 and #150, 6uL).

Ran for 105V, 60min.

![gelimageBSBround1] (https://github.com/thais-neu/BSBproject.md/blob/master/img/2020-02-27%20BSB%20gel1.jpg)

Most samples didn't work. Could be proteinase 1 is too old, or final DNA was too diluted in 400uL.

**Troubleshooting**

Testing enzyme and eluate volume in round 2 of extrations.

Samples selected for 2nd round of extractions, plate meethod:

| Location | UniqueID | Fin_clip_vial_ID|enzyme|note|
|:---------|:--------:|:--------------:|-------|----|
| Sara's Iceland cod sample | NA | #24 | Lotterhos lab "2"| positive ctrl |
| Sara's Iceland cod sample | NA | #24 | Hughes lab | positive ctrl |
| MD | Cs_MD_136 | Cs_MD_061 | Lotterhos lab "2"| didnt run in round 1|
| MD | Cs_MD_136 | Cs_MD_061 | Hughes lab | didn't run in round 1|
| SN | Cs_SN_179 | 79 | Lotterhos lab "1" | didn't work in round 1|
| NEG| NA | NA |

Testing the enzyme: samples #24 and #136 are run side by side with Lotterhos enzyme 2 (not used in round 1) and enzyme from Hughes lab (newer kit).
Testing the elution volume: all samples are going to be eluted tomorrow in a final volume of 100uL (2x 50uL); using enzyme 1 (same used in round 1) with sample #79 (didn't work in round 1) - if this one works, it means enzyme "1" works, but elution vol needs to be lower.
