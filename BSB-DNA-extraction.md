## Black Sea Bass Genomics Project 

First round of DNA extractions (Feb 2020):

Sample selection criteria: total lenght of fish < than 30cm (except those from ME).

| Location | Number of individuals | Notes |
|----------|:-----------------------:|-------|
|Maryland, MD| 20 | 20 selected out of 28, pick smallest; all < 30cm |
|Maine, ME| 5 | all 5 samples available in Feb 2020; 2 < 30cm, 3 > 30cm |
|North Carolina, NC | 15 | all 15 samples available; all < 30cm |
|New Jersey, NJ | 20 | 20 selected out of 30, pick smallest; all < 30cm |
|Southern New England, SN | 4 | selected 4 out of 7 pick smallest; all < 30cm |
| **Total** | **64** | *Goal = 64 samples; multiples of 8 are easier to work with*|

We are hoping to collect more fish from New England and Maine in Summer 2020.





### DNA extraction from fish fin clips.

Bench prep and materials

* 1st bleach entire benchtop
* 2nd EtOH entire benchtop
* gloves
* beaker with ~50mL EtOH
* ligther
* blades - one per sample
* sharps container
* trash
* scale
* weigh paper - one per sample
* kimwipes
* lysis plate and plate seal paper - from kit*
* TL buffer - 200 uL per sample** - from kit*
* protease solution 25 uL per sample - from kit*

* kit = E-Z 96 tissue DNA kit (D1196-01 Omega)
For plates:
** pour TL in a sterile weigh boat and use multi-channel to load plate wells. Tips should not touch side of wells, if they do, replace tips.
For spin tubes:


Procedure

Samples are in EtOH or RNA later or OGL buffer in the -20oC freezer. 

Samples in EtOH: none
Samples in RNAlater: ME, SN
Samples in OGL buffer: from NC, MD and NJ.

Take out 4-8 samples at the time in ice bucket or cold beads.
Wipe bench with EtOH and gloved hands (between samples).
Flame tweezers (between samples) and blade (use one per sample).
Set weigh paper (use one per sample) onto scale and tare.
Take out a fin clip from first sample tube and place on a fresh kimwipe and squeeze with tweezers and blade to dry it out/get rid of liquid, to get accurate weight.
Cut a piece of the fin and weigh it â€“ aim for 15 to 20 mg. Save the leftover sample, put back in sample tube.
Remove the weigh paper with fin and cut up fin in smaller pieces.
Place cut up sample into corresponding plate well using tweezers (if a piece falls out or touches any other surface, discard).
Repeat.
